I'm excited to share my latest achievement – a fully functional calculator built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was not just about creating a basic calculator;
it was a journey of exploration and learning. Leveraging the power of HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, I meticulously crafted each component to ensure
seamless functionality and an intuitive user experience. From simple arithmetic operations to more complex calculations, this calculator showcases my proficiency in frontend development and
my ability to translate ideas into tangible digital solutions. It's not just about the end product; it's about the process – the challenges overcome, the lessons learned, and the
satisfaction of seeing a project come to life.
